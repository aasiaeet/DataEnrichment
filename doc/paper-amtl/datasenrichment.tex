% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{icml2019} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2019} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
%\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
\usepackage{icml2019}

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
%\usepackage[accepted]{icml2019}

% The \icmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.
% Therefore, a short form for the running title is supplied here:

	% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
	% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
	% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2019
	% package.
	
	% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
	% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
	% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
	% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country
	
	% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
	% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
	% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.
