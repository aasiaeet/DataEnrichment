%It is worth noting that data sharing framework has tight connections to multi-task learning

%\subsection{Connection to multitask learning and Rubin's causality}

%Like any high dimensional model, questions about the data sharing model concerns sample complexity required for recovering the parameters and the non-asymptotic rate of estimation error.
%Here, the more interesting question is about the common parameter. 
%Is the sample complexity of $\bbeta_0^*$ depends on the data of all groups? 
%What about the rate of the error bound? 
%In other words, we are investigating the conjecture that the pooled data from all groups will facilitate estimation of the common parameter in both samples complexity and error bound rate regards. 
%In our work, we explicitly answer these questions.
