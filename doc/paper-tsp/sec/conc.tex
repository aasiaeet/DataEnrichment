\section{Conclusion}
We presented an estimator for the joint estimation of common and individual parameters of the data sharing model. 
We showed that the sample complexity for estimation of the shared parameter depends on the total number of sample $n$.
In addition, the shared parameter error rate decays as $1/\sqrt{n}$. 
These results indicate that our estimator benefits from the pooled data in estimating the common parameters. 
Both sample complexity and upper bound of error depend on the \emph{maximum} Gaussian width among the spherical caps induced by the error cones of all parameters.
We provided a projected gradient descent algorithm for estimation of the parameters and analyzed its convergence rate and showed geometric convergence for a carefully selected step size. Finally, we complemented the theoretical results presented with simulation results.
